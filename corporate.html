      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>In the social media campaign we want to share our brand message and attract people to our brand. Our message is that we want our target audience, students, to take control of their own life, be rebellious, bold and have freedom. By communicating this message we want the consumers to feel empowered to do this and to live a happier life. This all can be achieved by trying (in this case drinking) our product, the Rebel Lion beer.</p>
	<p>	
 <b> Promotional activities </b>
	<br>
		We did all of our promotional activities on Instagram. Out of the interviews done with our target audience we found out that most of them use Instagram as the most used social media platform. There was no doubt that this was going to be the platform we were going to communicate through. At first we also thought about using TikTok to communicate to the target audience, but after some interviews we found out that this is not a platform used by many students in the age range of our target audience. This is why we have chosen to only use Instagram. We wanted to communicate our message and product with the target audience in a good way, so that our brand is being remembered by the consumers. After the interviews we concluded that the brand account of Bol.com is liked by many students, because of the way they communicate their brand and products. This is done in a funny and sarcastic way, without pushing their products into their consumers' faces all the time. We want to take the same approach and have varied posts of funny content, content about our product, about our brand and pictures of our beer / places where you can drink our beer. 
		</p>
	 <p>
		<b>Objectives</b>
		<br>
		We have set up the following objectives for our promotional campaign:
	  <br>
	  </p>
	
			<p>
		<b> Reach objective</b>
		<br>
<i>We want to have a reach of 225 likes on our Instagram posts by April 14th 2022.</i>
 <br>
We want to post a total of 9 posts on Instagram. We have researched other new accounts on Instagram of brands and they have around 10 to 40 likes per post. Some accounts we have researched are @samaya_graphics, @cafecouture and @integritybotanicals. These are businesses that have not been active on instagram for long. Since we are also a completely new brand, we will be at the lower end of the likes that those accounts have. We aim to reach around 25 likes per post, and will post 9 posts in total. This means that we will have around 225 likes in total on April 14th 2022.
	  </p>
<p>
<b> Affect objective</b>
		  <br>
<i>
	We want our audience to recognize the problems we experience and feel a connection to our brand. We want to inspire them to stand up for themself and feel motivated. We also want to make them feel like they are not the only ones facing this problem.
	</i>
	  </p>
	  <p>
 <b>Response objective</b>
		  <br>
<i>We want our audience to start taking matters into their own hands and stand up for themself. To take control of their own life.
</i>
<br>
By drinking a Rebel Lion our target audience will feel more comfortable getting out of their comfort zone. Our drink unites people, makes them more confident, happy and forces them to take control of their own lives. This is due to the message where our brand stands for, and the alcohol percentage in the beer.
</p>
	  
      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>It turned out that we were way too ambitious with setting up our reach objective, and that our  promotional campaign went worse than we had anticipated. The reach objective we had was to reach 225 likes over 9 Instagram posts before april 14th 2022. This objective was based on data we gathered on other starting brand accounts. We wanted to do this with content of images only. At the time of writing this, which is April 14th, 15:00hrs, the total number of likes we have is 69. This is way below our objective of 225 likes. We did not expect we would get this few likes. We do not know the amount of views our posts received.</p>
	  <p>
		We thought that using only images would increase our likes, as our target group is frequently in situations where it is not possible to view content with audio. This assumption turned out to be wrong. We did some research on brands made by other second years, and we found that video content, especially Instagram reels and TikTok videos, received more views than images. So that is something we would definitely do differently. We would expand our content to also include short video content in our campaign. This would create more brand awareness. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
The creation of the posts went as expected. We used our vision and values as a starting point for the design of our posts. This helped us create the posts more easily. We also used our product to create good looking visuals. If we had to do this again, we would try to create even more coherence between the posts based on our values, and posts based on our product.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p> When we started this project we planned everything that had to be done. This planning had many different points and every point had its own bullet points. Sometimes it was difficult for us to keep to this plan. For example the content planner was made before the content was posted on Instagram. However not every post was posted according to this planner, due to finding out that there were times scheduled to post that did not work well with the amount of engagement that we had expected. We found out that posting in the morning or afternoon gave us more engagement rather than posting in the evening.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		We were content with the amount of posts a week that we had planned to post, we did not spam others or get complaints about the frequency of posting. We reminded our followers of our brand and products because of the posts on Instagram.
</p>
	  <p>
		  <b>Future recommendations</b>
		  <br>
	In the future we would keep posting as we were doing, but change the times when we posted. Besides that we would make use of short video content and the Instagram stories to attract more people. We have looked at other brands and found out that this attracts a lot of consumers due to the short video that can contain a lot of information about your brand, and the short reminders or games/quizzes that can be shared on Instagram stories. 
	A short video about our brand can give the consumer a more broad and clear overview of what our brand or product is really like. This can be posted on the feed as a regular video, or as a reel.
</p>
	<p> 
		<b>Schedule</b>
		<br>
		We would use the following posting schedule if we would continue to post our promotional activities

		<p>
			<b>What we would do differently</b>
			<br>
	Most of the work during this project went pretty smoothly between the three of us. We communicated well and gave everyone tasks of what had to be done before what time. 
			<br>
	If we had to come up with things that we would do differently the next time, we would keep better planning and create posts more in advance. Because the project went by so fast, and at the start we -along with other groups- had some trouble setting up our brand, we got a little bit behind. In the future we would read everything in advance and keep a better plan to stay more organized. Besides that we would post more content on social media, such as videos and reels to bring more variety in the posts and make use of additional features, such as Instagram stories. Using TikTok as an extra social media platform can also be a good addition for our brand. Even though we found out that TikTok is not used by many students from our target audience, using more platforms could help us to reach more people. However, if we decide to post on TikTok, we would have to plan more and spend more time on making content.
